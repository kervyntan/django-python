Using paths 
Redirecting:
    - URL paths inside path() function can have *names* that can be referenced
    - Django has a reverse() function to find the corresponding URL path

path('<int:num_page>/', views.num_page_view),
path('<str:topic>/', views.dynamic_view, name="dynamic_view") -> redirected to here
